# Hello-World
My first repository 
My fellow Earthicans, hello!
My name is Latifah and I'm new to this whole coding thing. Although I have no background in tech and only started a few months ago, I'm loving it! Once I complete my web development immersion program in September I would like to work for GitHub remotely and be part of a large collaborative community. I look forward to contributing as much as I can between now and September to build up a great portfolio.
